## WINTER_EU_Database

*This project has received funding from the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS) under GRANT AGREEMENT No.101057228*
***
### Project Overview

The geodatabase developed within the framework of the project is available online at the following GitHub repository:
[WINTER_EU_Database](https://github.com/WINTER-project-eu/WINTER_EU_Database).

The database contains both spatial and non-spatial information, which includes:

+ Spatial data: Regional boundaries, land cover types, mining areasâ€™ boundaries, etc.
+ Non-spatial data: Texts, photos, diagrams that are part of the narrative storytelling maps.

### Narrative Storytelling Maps

The non-spatial data collected for this project will be used to develop narrative stories for the following regions:

+ Western Macedonia
+ Konin
+ Ruhr area

These stories are hosted on the ArcGIS Online platform and provide valuable insights into the regions. All non-spatial information used in the storytelling maps has been visualized and converted into PDF format. The PDFs are accessible online in the GitHub repository.

### Data Sources

The table below lists the sources used for the web platform, categorized by type (spatial or non-spatial).

| Type       | Data Layer/Description                        | Source         | Resolution/Scale |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Spatial    | Land Cover/Land Use (Vector)                  | Corine Land Cover (CLC) | 50 to 10 meters  |
| Spatial    | Regional & Open-pit Mines Boundaries (Vector) | Subtask 2.3.1  | N/A              |
| Spatial    | Land Cover Maps (Vector)                      | Subtask 2.3.1  | 20 meters        |
| Spatial    | Digital Suitability Maps (Vector)             | Subtask 2.3.2  | N/A              |
| Non-Spatial| Mine Rehabilitation & Reclamation Showcases (Texts/Images) | Task 2.1 | N/A |
| Non-Spatial| Legal Framework & Legislations (Texts)        | Task 2.2       | N/A              |

### Geodatabase Description

The geospatial dataset consists of 6 geodatabases with a total of 50 feature classes, created for subtasks 2.3.1 and 2.3.2. The structure of the geodatabases is outlined below:

### Subtask 2.3.1 Geodatabases

+ geodatabases were created for the following regions:
  - Western Macedonia
  - Konin
  - Ruhr area
  - Geographical boundaries

### Subtask 2.3.2 Geodatabases

+ 2 geodatabases were created for the different regions.

Below is a visual representation of the geodatabase structure:
